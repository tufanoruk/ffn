# Find Furthest Number

"This test measures your speed and accuracy in carrying out number tasks in your head. For each problem presented, start by finding the highest and the lowest of the three numbers displayed.Having identified those, decide whether the highest number or the lowest number is numerically further away  from the remaining number."

Example. 
For series of numbers "9 3 7", "7" is the middle number "3" is further from "7" then "9", thus answer is "3"

This mimics a part of GIA test for number speed and accuracy.

This is a toy project to understand working with C++17 with VSCode, CMake and boos.asio.
