# Find Furthest Number

"This test measures your speed and accuracy in carrying out number tasks in your head. For each problem presented, start by finding the highest and the lowest of the three numbers displayed.Having identified those, decide whether the highest number or the lowest number is numerically further away  from the remaining number."

Example. "9 3 7"
         "7" is the middle number
         "3" is further from "7" then "9"

This mimics a part of GIA test for number speed and accuracy

This is a toy project to understand working with C++17 with VSCode, CMake and boos.asio.
